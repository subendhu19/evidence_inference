This repository contains my experiments for the task of Evidence Inference.

The code is written to run on both CPU and GPU (default device - 0). To run the experiments, simply run the following command from the root directory -

./bin/run_trainer.sh 

You can change the hyper-parameters by looking at the arg-parse in trainer.py and passing in the appropriate info with flags.
